    <string name="compose_short_desc">jetPack compose is a modern toolkit for
    building native Android UI. Compose simplifies and accelerates UI development
    on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs</string>
    <string name="compose_long_desc">In this tutorial, you build a simple UI component
    with declarative functions. You call compose functions to say what elements you want and
    the compose compiler does the rest. Compose is build around composable functions.
    These functions let you define your app\'s UI programmatically because the let you
    describe how it should look and provide data dependencies, rather then focus on the process
    of UI\'s construction, such as initializing an element and then attaching it to a parent
    .To create a composable function, you add the @Composable annotation to the function name. </string>
